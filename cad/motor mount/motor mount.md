# Explain

This is the initial sketch which mostly makes up the base of the motor mount. The mount hole is fitted for a NEMA 17 motor. The slot holes are fitted for the m3 screws meanwhile while the two large holes used to  stabilize the holder on the profiles. The holders part going downward is fitted slightly to the right for the capstan motor and pulleys to be aligned with the center of the motor for efficient movement. as you can see for that it is directly aligned with the left side f the motor mount for that as well.

Next it was extruded and it was onto the other part of the sketch.


I added this top part

![[machine buidling/cad/motor mount/4.png]]This was done so I could fit the pulley there behind the motors extension fitted on the NEMA's shaft.

THE MOTOR MOUNT IS DONE
