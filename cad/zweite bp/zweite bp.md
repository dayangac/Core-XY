first I created the base sketch![[bs.png]]Then I added the screw holes![[machine buidling/cad/bearing_plate/2.png]]lastly I modified the back hole to be a slot with slightly more space![[slt.png]]
then I extruded
![[ext.png]]then I chamfered the outer edges![[chamf.png]]finally I added chamfers to the bottom squares sides and fillets to the top squares sides and the design was done![[fi.png]]
now it was onto making the further modifications as for a version of the plate with less holes for parts a smaller plate for purposes needing one as such. First added the bottom slot cutout.![[but.png]]
Then the top cut out
![[tto.png]]finally I did the extrusions and got this![[s.png]]
fail time.) I later realized that I didn't need the smaller screw holes in the repeated formation that was given in the bp1 thus I went back in the sketch and got rid of them in the intial sketch and now will re-add them in appropriate locations that work for the piece

I sketched and constrained them
![[machine buidling/cad/zweite bp/3.png]]and then cut em out to have the final zweite bp!
