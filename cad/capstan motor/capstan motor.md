I first wondered what a capstan once since my mentor always asks the definition of every small thing. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. 

A capstan is a vertical-axled rotating machine developed for use on sailing ships to multiply the pulling force of sailors when hauling ropes, cables, and hawsers. 

{More deliberation of how capstan work}

I first created the base of the capstan![[machine buidling/cad/capstan motor/1.png]]
then I extruded it

and then cut it through the body

Then it was time for the revolute but before that I projected the two circular faces on the xy to properly setup the revoluting body![[rev.png]]
then setup the tri to be revoluated so the string could wrap around![[5.png]]

next I repeated the revolute using the R-pattern for the thread to easily go around the whole body
![[6.png]]![[7.png]]finally I closed off the top since we don't. need a hole there and it was only temporary! I closed it using the added construction plane by doing a to object extursion of the hole from the top to the plane creating a snug fit for the motor shaft
