Again I did the base circle with the said dimensions
![[machine buidling/cad/capstan pulley/1.png]]
Then once again with symmetric extrusion I extruded it to 18 mm![[symm.png]]then once again I sketched and through whole cut the top hole![[machine buidling/cad/capstan pulley/3.png]]![[tophole.png]]then I didi the revolution triangle sketch once again![[tt.png]]
and then revolved it![[revolve.png]]
then I created the construction plane to make the drawing of the bearing holder![[t.png]]
Next I projected that side of the const. plane to the ZY plane to draw yet anotehr revolve template
